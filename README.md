# McGill ECSE 444

This project was completed in the context of the final project of the course ECSE 444 at McGill University.

It implements a multi-sensor interactive system for real-time data acquisition, processing, and storage using the STM32 microcontroller. The system integrates features such as QSPI flash memory, I2C-based sensors (temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope), DFSDM microphone for audio input, and UART for debugging and feedback. By leveraging CMSIS-DSP, it performs FFT analysis to detect dominant frequencies, enabling tone-controlled sensor selection. Sensor data is stored in QSPI memory, and retrieved on user demand.
